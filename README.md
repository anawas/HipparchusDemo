# HipparchusDemo
Hipparchus is a fork of the Apache Commons Math Library (ACML). Unlike ACML Hipparchus is actively maintained and updated regularly. 
The current version is well ahead of the latest (but still old) ACML, which is 3.6.1.

## Numerik mit Kotlin
This code will be part of my new tutorial series "Numerik mit Kotlin". It will be available in German only.
The series will cover a lot of numerical methods based on the Kotlin programming language.
This is because I am convinced, that Kotlin is as powerful as Python
for scientific and numerical computing.
